# TerrainMesh

**TerrainMesh** is a [SCNNode](https://developer.apple.com/reference/scenekit/scnnode) subclass which aims to simplify the creation of custom **SceneKit** geometry for triangle meshes. It also provides built-in support/example APIs for deformation and manipulation of the mesh.

It was created as a simple / fun exploratory demonstration of deformable SceneKit terrain.

## Performance

The TerrainMesh class can be used as-is for a variety of purposes including terrain generation or manipulation, but it is by no means the most efficient or practical way of achieving this. For more links on the topic, please check out the blog post linked above.
