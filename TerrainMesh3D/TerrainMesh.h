/** TerrainMesh is a custom SCNNode which automatically generates
    a triangle mesh of an arbitrary resolution, which can then
    be deformed or manipulated. This can be used for rendering
    terrain or other custom shapes in SceneKit. The current
    API is relatively simple and is mostly for demonstration
    purposes, but could be easily extended as needed. */

    this will determine the overall resolution and
    number of triangles of the mesh.
 
    @param sideLength
    The actual length of one side of the terrain. These

    in, and a custom z-depth can be returned (the effective
    "height" of that vertex in the terrain). This allows
    for easy customization of the terrain mapping.
