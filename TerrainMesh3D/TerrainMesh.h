/** TerrainMesh is a custom SCNNode which automatically generates
    a triangle mesh of an arbitrary resolution, which can then
    be deformed or manipulated. This can be used for rendering
    terrain or other custom shapes in SceneKit. The current
    API is relatively simple and is mostly for demonstration
    purposes, but could be easily extended as needed. */

/** Creates a new terrain mesh node.
 
    @param verticesPerSide
    The number of vertices on each side of the mesh,
    this will determine the overall resolution and
    number of triangles of the mesh.
 
    @param sideLength
    The actual length of one side of the terrain. These
    units are arbitrary and only meaningful within the
    context of your particular scene. */

    Optional block that will be called when the terrain
    mesh is generated. The vertex location X,Y is passed
    in, and a custom z-depth can be returned (the effective
    "height" of that vertex in the terrain). This allows
    for easy customization of the terrain mapping.

    @param point
    Relative X,Y location on the terrain mesh. X and Y should
    be in the range of 0.0 - 1.0, where 0,0 is the lower range
    vertices, or "bottom left" of the mesh and 1.0,1.0 represents
    the highest vertices, or "top right" portion of the terrain.
 
    @param brushRadius
    Size of the deformation, this is a relative value, where
    0.5 is half the size of the mesh. Therefore, a brush at
    point 0.5, 0.5 (center of terrain) with a radius of 0.5
    would be a circle that was the same size as the entire
    terrain. */
